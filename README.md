# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio to showcase my projects, provide some insite into who I am, and to offer a way to contact me. This portfolio was created as part of Scrimba's Front End Developer Career Path boot camp. A template was used for this portfolio, and all credit is provided inside the index.html file.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a recent graduate of Fort Hays State University graduating with an Informational Technology bachelor's degree with a focus in web and mobile application development. Through school course work, and the online bootcamp Scrimba that I am completing in order to further my learning, I have worked with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, React, Python, SQL, PHP, MongoDB, and Firebase.

Previously, I earned a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a focus in Accounting from Columbia College of Missouri. Following that degree, I spent nearly six years working at a non-profit organization as a program coordinator and a program manager where I was tasked with recruiting and training volunteers on how to complete tax returns as part of the IRS's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program. In those six seasons, the program completed over 15,000 tax returns for people from low and middle income households.

Other projects:

## ðŸ›  Skills

I have learned, and continue to learn, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have completed coursework using React, Python, SQL, and PHP. I believe my best skills are an enthusiasm for learning and problem solving. I love figuring out how to best solve a problem, and if it requires learning something to do it, then even more fun!
